# PRISMAq: Pan-American Research Initiative for the Study of Macroinvertebrates in Aquatic Habitats

## 🌎 Call for Scientists Across the Americas

**Are you interested in freshwater biodiversity?**  
Join **PRISMAq** and contribute to the study of ponds, springs, and headwater streams—vital for aquatic biodiversity and still underrepresented in continental studies.

### 🚀 Project Objective
Analyze the patterns and key factors affecting macroinvertebrate biodiversity in small water bodies across the Americas, contributing to the conservation of these vulnerable habitats.

### 🌱 Expected Impact
- **Conservation**: Generate valuable data to support freshwater ecosystem conservation strategies.
- **Biodiversity**: Expand knowledge on the patterns and processes that influence biodiversity in smaller water bodies.
- **Collaboration**: Foster a network of researchers dedicated to the ecology and conservation of freshwater ecosystems.
